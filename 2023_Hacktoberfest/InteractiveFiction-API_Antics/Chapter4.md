## Chapter 4: A Reactive Response
Sam decides to dig deeper into the codebase for further research.   

Just a response alone encouraged her --  How could this not have been a compliment?  

As an overachiever, she wanted to find an edge case -- doing both work and fun at the same time.  A little more googling found the scariest prime number -- Belphegor's prime.  She was proud!   

Now, she wanted to get her goblin's reaction.  She thought before she answered -- is my goblin a developer, novice, jokester, or something else.  She answered with a response that anyone could understand and also put the system to the test. Hopefully it will not filter out my new unknown tags and my goblin can read everything I wrote.

```
{
  "goblins": [
    {
      "name": "Grumble",
      "answer": "1100100111110010110010011100110100000100011101100001100010100100001100011110000010101000000000000001"
      "readableprime": "1000000000000066600000000000001"
      "primename": "Belphegor's prime"
    }
  ]
}
```

This time, an immediate response... 

```
{
  "goblins": [
    {
      "name": "Anonymous",
      "response": "Tremble in fear as you create your own request!"
    }
  ]
}
```

She wondered, what is the meaning of this?

### What does Sam decide to do next?
- If Sam feels confident that she does not need the goblins and attempts to make a request that bypasses them altogether, turn to [Chapter 8](Chapter8.md).
- If Sam is spooked by the quick responses and decides to leave early for the day, turn to [Chapter 9](Chapter9.md).
