_This story was started by Jen Bauer with the help of AI in the form of ChatGPT, then adjusted further and given additional detail through magic, imagination, and Markdown._

Additional authors who added to this story are:
- Jen Bauer with ChaptGPT, Chapter 1
- Jen Bauer, Chapter 2

- TBD, looking forward to seeing who jumps in!


#### *A few quick thoughts on this project before you jump in:*
- The Issues in the repository will outline how to add to this story and help set the pace, but the basic idea is as follows:
    - When there is a choice created that is incomplete, feel free to add in another chapter to continue our Protagonist's story, writing in that chapter yourself as you like.  There is no limit to what you can use to help you write - simply have fun in the process and enjoy practicing your Markdown and Git skills as part of Hacktober. :)
    - You can create as many choices as you like for the story to go in.  If you do, create placeholder chapter files (ie Chapter#.md) to help avoid conflicts later on.
    - If the story becomes too large or complex, we may stop it there or move it elsewhere.  Who knows!  Let's just have fun for now. ;)
    - Don't forget to add yourself as an author on this first page here.  It'd be fun to see how this list grows over time.
- Improvisational comedy has the concept of "yes and", which is the idea of keeping yourself open to new situations in the moment so that a scene can grow and keep being interesting.  Keep your options open!  See where you can go next, and leave opportunities for your characters and the situation to go in different directions.
- It's OK if we create a few dead-ends, since those surprises are also part of the fun in Choose Your Own Adventures style stories!
- The prime directive above all is to have fun with this project. :D

## **Chapter 1: The Enigmatic Endpoint**
In the bustling headquarters of DevTech Inc., where code flowed like a digital river not unlike the lovely Reedy River of downtown Greenville, a QA engineer named Sam stumbled upon an unusual API endpoint while creating a new automated test suite. The endpoint, "/api/goblin," was buried deep within the company's vast codebase, and yet was not part of the Swagger spec or any other documentation. Curiosity piqued, so Sam decided to call the endpoint to see what she could gather.  She received a baffling JSON response:

```
{
  "goblins": [
    {
      "name": "Grumble",
      "quirk": "Only speaks in riddles",
      "request": "Send me a list of prime numbers in binary."
    },
    {
      "name": "Squeak",
      "quirk": "Hides in nested arrays",
      "request": "Find me a Fibonacci sequence in reverse."
    }
  ]
}
```

The response contained a list of peculiar goblins, each with its own quirk and their own bizarre API request. 

### What does Sam decide to do next?
- If Sam chuckles at the absurdity of it all and decides to play along by making a request to the first goblin, move to [Chapter 2](Chapter2.md).
- If Sam ignores these responses and goes about her other tasks during the day, move to [Chapter 3](Chapter3.md).
